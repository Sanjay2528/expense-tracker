#Expense Tracker – Python Project

 #⁠Project Overview

Managing day-to-day expenses is one of the most common problems faced by students and households. People often forget how much they spend, and keeping manual notes becomes difficult.
This project is a simple command-line Expense Tracker that allows users to record expenses, view summaries, and analyse spending patterns.

This project is developed as part of the Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming course to apply Python basics to a real-world scenario.



 #Problem Definition

People regularly perform small cash or digital transactions, but do not have an easy way to:
	•	Track what they spent
	•	Categorize expenses
	•	Calculate total spending
	•	Analyse which category consumes more money

The absence of a simple tracking system leads to poor financial awareness.



 #⁠Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
	•	To create a program that allows users to log daily expenses
  
	•	To organise expenses by categories
  
	•	To display total money spent
  
	•	To provide category-wise summaries
  
	•	To help users understand and manage their spending habits



 #⁠Features
	•	Add new expense with amount, category and description
  
	•	View all logged expenses
  
	•	Display total expenditure
  
	•	Show category-wise spending summary
  
	•	Simple and clean command-line menu



 #⁠Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	No external libraries required
